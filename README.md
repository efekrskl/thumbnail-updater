This is a small project for a youtube video. The video's initial thumbnail would be completely blurred, however the
image would be slowly unblurred on each 1K view milestone. At 10K views the image would be completely unblurred.

Here's the video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rfAGjxN29U

// TODO
- Add a proper README
- Maybe improve error handling
